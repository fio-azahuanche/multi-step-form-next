# Multi-step Form Solution

This is my solution to the [desafÃ­o Multi-step Form en Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). This challenge helped me improve my skills in building interactive user interfaces and managing state in modern applications.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the form sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections in the final step and confirm their order
- View a responsive design depending on their device screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- Receive validation messages if:
  - A required field is missing
  - The email format is incorrect
  - A step is submitted without a selection
